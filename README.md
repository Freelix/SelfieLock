## Installation

It's an old project and it is not supported anymore. Furthermore, bluetooth technology didn't work as well as we thought it would, so we didn't publish it. The server is also not available since it was only used for a short time. You can always use this code as a starting point and run it with a software like [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
